# Crypto Clustering

## Description

In this task, my objective is to utilize my Python skills and unsupervised learning techniques to predict whether cryptocurrencies are influenced by changes in prices over a 24-hour or 7-day period.

## Instructions

1. Prepare the Data
   
2. Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame

## Questions and Observations

>*  **Q:** After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?

>*  **A:** Utilizing fewer features in the clustering process did not have a significant impact on the final outcomes. Although it led to clusters being more closely grouped together, there were no significant differences in the assignment of cryptocurrencies to each cluster.
